# IntoTech 2017
## Arduino Workshop
Let’s break the ice and get started in the makers’ movement by assembling a pre-designed hardware project from scratch! Come join as as we hit the ground running by prototyping your very own electronics project using Arduino and C++. No electronics or programming knowledge is required! 

Requirements: Please bring along a laptop. You don’t need to have any software preinstalled, however please download the [Arduino installer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) ahead of the workshop. We recommend listening to the The IoT Talk from Jamie happening directly before this workshop, as they are connected! 

This workshop is supported with material by [Conrad Electronics](https://www.conrad.at/).

### Prerequisites
These items are used for this workshop:
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- DHT Library (should come with the Arduino IDE)
  - Learn about libraries and how to install them [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc2)

### Parts shopping list (to build at home if you want)
- 1 16x2 Character LCD Display
- 1 400-point breadboard
- 1 Arduino-compatible Pro Micro*
  - * This Arduino might require soldering the header pins to the Arduino
- 1 10k trim pot
- 1 330 Ohm resistor
- 1 DHT22 sensor
- 1 10k Ohm resistor for use with DHT22
- 1 USB to micro USB cable
- 2 male-male jumper wires

### Resources
- [Glyphduino library](http://rastating.github.io/Glyphduino/) - library with pre-made glyphs
- [Customer character generator](http://fusion94.org/lcdchargen/) - make your own custom glyphs in a web UI and get the code
